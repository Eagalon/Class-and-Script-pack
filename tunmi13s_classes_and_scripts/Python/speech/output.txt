This is the output class, created by the Lucia developers and contributors.
This output class makes it easy to output speech to screen readers.
The following functions are available.
speak(text,interrupt=false): Speaks some text. Interrupt flag controls whether the speech should interrupt any prior spoken text.
output.speak("Hi there.")
output.speak("Bye.",True)
silence(): Silences text.
output.speak("Shut up.",True)
output.silence()
is_active(): Returns true or false based on whether system output is active or not.
if output.is_active == False:
	print("Oops. Where's your screen reader!")
else:
	output.speak("Oh hi there.")
braille(text): Outputs text to a braille display, if one is connected.
output.braille("Hello.")
get_first_available_output(): Retrieves the first available output of your system and sets it as the default output.
