# Class and Script pack

This archive contains scripts, classes, and useful functions that I've either created manually or obtained from open-source projects such as [Lucia][lucia].

## Python
Inside this folder is everything related to [Python][py]. I will try to update and modify it in my spare time. If you notice anything wrong though, do not hesitate to contact me, open an issue, or submit a pull request.

NOTE: All attempts to simulate BGT have been depricated! Functions are simplified, but otherwise BGT is no longer the focus of this repository.

## Conclusion

I hope this helps people who are slowly moving over from BGT to [Python][py], or even those who don't know where to start.

## Credits

- Thanks goes to the [Lucia][lucia] developers and contributors, which is partially used in this collection of scripts and classes.
- Thanks goes to BrailleScreen in his attempt to improve the repo.
