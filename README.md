# Class and Script pack

This archive contains scripts, classes, and useful functions that I've either created manually or obtained from open-source projects such as [Lucia][lucia].

Inside this pack is everything related to [Python][py]. I will try to update and modify it in my spare time. If you notice anything wrong though, do not hesitate to contact me, open an issue, or submit a pull request.

NOTE: All attempts to simulate BGT have been depricated! Functions are simplified, but otherwise BGT is no longer the focus of this repository.

If you still insist on viewing the BGT scripts/classes I previously developed, you may view the [legacy][old] branch.

I hope this helps people who are slowly moving over from BGT to [Python][py], or even those who don't know where to start in terms of programming in Python.
