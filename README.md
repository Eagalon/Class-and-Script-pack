# Class and Script pack (Legacy Branch)

This branch contains the BGT classes and scripts I previously worked on before becoming a Python programmer.

None of these are being developed anymore, so I recommend the main branch. That branch holds all the Python-related classes and scripts.

## Installation
In order to run these BGT files, you must obtain the BGT installer. By default, Windows does not support BGT files. This will install the interpreter.

You can find the installer on places such as Blind Help, or fellow friends.

Have fun!
